# About

Development of the code base for Geode began in 2002 as the commercial product GemFire. The open source version of Geode was released in April, 2015. 

The [primary contributors](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/GeodeProposal) include long standing members of the GemFire engineering team, implementers and customers with long standing relationships.

The Apache Incubator Proposal for Geode can be found [here](https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/GeodeProposal).


## Project History

GemFire was launched as a result of lessons learnt from its predecessor - an object oriented database and its performance challenges in a highly scaled environment. The problems primarily stemmed from the centralized design in traditional database (RDB and Object oriented) and a design that used main-memory to optimize disk IO not application access patterns. 

The initial version of the product was a distributed caching product that allowed both C++ and Java applications to share objects in a scale out environment at high speeds. The team focussed on capital markets where the hunger for low latency was dominant with drastic changes through decimalization and regulations. 

It was through their experiences on Wall Street and the DoD (signal intelligence) that the team expanded to integrating real-time pub-sub and replication over the wide area network. All of this emerged well before the world had even heard the term NoSQL. 

GemFire, Tangosol Coherence (now Oracle) and Gigaspaces were the primary players in the creation of the IMDG. A new class of product that went beyond the traditional relational database. In <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/in-memory-data-grids">this article</a>, Jags Ramnarayan, the Chief Architect of GemFire, answers questions about in memory data.

Over time IMDGs started to get adopted in every single market - scalable web sites, travel apps, internet of things, and others.  Anyplace differentiation can be achieved through speed and immediate access to data, Geode is a great fit. 

Then, GemFire was purchased by VMWare in 2010 and was incorporated into the vFabric platform. It became a core component of vFabric Suite. At VMware, development continued, until April 2013, when GemFire became part of Pivotal. At Pivotal, GemFire has enjoyed being the fast, in memory component of Big Data Suite.

In February 2015, Pivotal announced plans to open source parts of the Big Data Suite, starting with GemFire.  On April 12, 2015, the GemFire core was released into open source under the name "Geode"."
