/**
 * Class <code>SerializedCacheValue</code> represents a serialized cache value.
 * Instances of this class obtained from a region can be put into another region
 * without a copy of this value being made. The two region entries will both have a
 * reference to the same value.
 * <p>
 * If this value originated from a region stored off heap then this object can
 * only be used as long as notification method that obtained it has not returned.
 * For example if your implementation of {@link CacheListener#afterUpdate(EntryEvent)} obtains one
 * by calling {@link EntryEvent#getSerializedOldValue()} then the SerializedCacheValue returned
 * is only valid until your afterUpdate method returns. It is not safe to store instances of this
 * class and use them later when using off heap storage.
 * Attempts to access off-heap data from this event after it has expired will result in an
 * IllegalStateException.
