  Provides utilities for use with the Caching API in the
<code>com.gemstone.gemfire.cache.util</code> package.
<p>
Adapter classes are provided for convenience in implementing the
CacheListener, RegionMembershipListener, RegionRoleListener, TransactionListener, and CacheWriter interfaces. These adapter
classes simply implement the interfaces with empty methods so that subclasses
only need implement the methods that are of interest.
